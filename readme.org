** Installation

*** From local copy

#+begin_src sh
  pip install /path/to/package

This should always run in under 5 minutes.

#+begin_src sh

  python3 tests/test.py TestBirthDeathExample
  python3 tests/test.py TestBirthDeathExample.test_output_shape
#+end_src

=source= directory. To build the documentation use the following:

#+begin_src sh
  make html
#+end_src
